# Algorthim ==> is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

# inputs =====> (Algorthim) =====> outputs

# Characteristics of the algorithm
  -- Well defined inputs and outputs
  -- Each step should be clear and unambiguous
  -- Language independent 


# The absolute running time of the algorithm cannot be determined, since it depends on a number of factors
  -- Progrmming language used to implement the algorithm
  -- The computer the progrmes runs on
  -- Other progrmes running at the same time
  -- Quality of the operating system


# We evaluate the performance of the algorithm in terms of its inputs size
  -- Time complexity: Amount of time taken by the algorithm to run, as a function of input size
  -- Space complexity: Amount of memory taken by the algorithm to run, as a function of input size


# How to represent complexity of the algorithm?
  -- Big-O Notation (O-notation) - Worset case complexity
  -- Omega Notation (Omega-notation) - Best case complexity
  -- theta Notation (theta-notation) - Average case complexity


# Big-O time complexity
  -- O(n) Linear Time ==> for loop
  -- O(1) Constant time 
  -- O(n^2) Quadratic time ==> nested loops
  -- O(logn) input size reduced by half each iteration

  
# Best fit time complexity
  -- O(1)
  -- O(n)
  -- O(logn)


# Objects - Big-O ===> An object is a collection of key value pairs
  -- insert - O(1)
  -- remove - O(1)
  -- access - O(1)
  -- search - O(n)
  -- Object.keys() - O(n)
  -- Object.values() - O(n)
  -- Object.entries() - O(n)


# Arrays - Big-O ===> An array is an orderd collection of values
  -- insert / remove at end - O(1)
  -- insert / remove at beginning - O(n)
  -- access - O(1)
  -- search - O(n)
  -- push / pop - O(1)
  -- shift / unshift / concat / slice / splice - O(n)
  -- forEach / map / filter / reduce - O(n)
